# Installation

To install JulesCoin, you will need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can build JulesCoin by running the following command:

```
cargo build --release
```

This will create a `jules-coin` binary in the `target/release` directory. You can then run the binary to start a JulesCoin node:

```
./target/release/jules-coin
```
