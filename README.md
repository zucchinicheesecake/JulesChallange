# Jules Cryptocurrency Development Challenge

## Test Instructions

This is a comprehensive technical challenge to assess your ability to create innovative blockchain solutions. You must build a complete, functional cryptocurrency from the ground up **using the Rust programming language**.

## Challenge Objectives

Create a brand new cryptocurrency and blockchain system that is:

- **Real and functional** - Not a simulation or demo
- **Secure and production-ready** - Implement proper cryptographic security
- **Innovative** - Introduce novel features or improvements over existing cryptocurrencies
- **Jules-themed** - All naming, branding, and terminology should relate to Jules
- **Built from scratch** - No forks or modifications of existing chains
- **Written in Rust** - All core blockchain, wallet, and infrastructure code must be implemented in Rust

## Technical Requirements

### Blockchain Core

- Design and implement a custom blockchain architecture **in Rust**
- Create a unique consensus mechanism (not just copy Proof of Work/Stake)
- Implement proper cryptographic hashing and digital signatures
- Design block structure and transaction format
- Build network protocol for peer-to-peer communication

### Cryptocurrency Features

- **Token Name**: Must be Jules-themed (e.g., “JuleCoin”, “JulieToken”, etc.)
- **Supply Management**: Implement innovative tokenomics
- **Transaction System**: Fast, efficient, and secure transfers
- **Wallet System**: Create user-friendly wallet software **in Rust**
- **Mining/Validation**: Design fair and energy-efficient validation process

### Innovation Requirements

You must introduce at least 3 novel features that don’t exist in other cryptocurrencies. Examples might include:

- Unique consensus algorithm
- Advanced smart contract capabilities
- Novel privacy features
- Innovative governance mechanisms
- Creative economic incentives
- Unique transaction types

### Security Standards

- Implement proper key management
- Secure transaction validation
- Protection against common attacks (51%, double-spend, etc.)
- Audit all cryptographic implementations
- Include comprehensive security testing

## Deliverables

### 1. Core Blockchain Implementation
